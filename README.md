# Genes and Pathways in ICC Response to GC and ICB Therapy
This repository contains all materials for a bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) mouse models treated with gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC), immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), or a combination of both. It includes: <br>
<br>
R Markdown (.Rmd) file – Code for differential expression analysis, statistical testing, and visualization of RNA-seq results. <br>
<br>
Manuscript – Full paper detailing study design, methods, results, and conclusions on genes and pathways implicated in ICC treatment response.
<br>
This repository enables reproducibility of the analysis and highlights novel genes, including lncRNAs and annotated genes, associated with ICC response to GC chemotherapy and ICB therapy, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets.
